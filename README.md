### Hi there 👋

I am Łukasz, a front-end developer based in Gdańsk, Poland 😄

👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently a React Developer @ Bank Millennium. 

🔥 I am passionate about crafting apps solving the laziness problem



When I am not working on my projects you can definitely find me stretching on a yoga mat 🧘🏻‍♂️, trying to rock on ukulele 🎶 or looking into the stars 🌌.


📫 I you want to reach me out visit one of my websites
